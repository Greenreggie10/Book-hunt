!-- Title 
# Book-hunt






## !-- Synopsis -->

A fully functional google book search engine created with Restful API which I refactored it to the GraphQL. Built with Apollo server with the use of the MERN stack with react front end MongoDB database, Node.js, Express and API ## Features You can search, save, use and delete books.

The app allows users to search the Google Books API search engine for book data. When a user logs in, they can add books to their personal library of saved books and remove them once read. The single-page application features a home page to search for books, as well as a saved books page that is visible when the user logs in.
